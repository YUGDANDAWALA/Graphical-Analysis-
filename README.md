# Graphical-Analysis-
This system provides a comprehensive graphical analysis of Indian cricketers, focusing exclusively on batting and bowling statistics across all international formats. It utilizes real-time data by fetching updated statistics directly from ESPN Cricinfo via URL-based scraping. The retrieved data is stored in a Mysql Xampp database, which is then used to generate insightful visualizations. These plots enable a clearer and more intuitive understanding of player performance trends over the years.
